INTRODUCTION

In every organization, sales performance analysis should never be compromised on. The aim of this analysis is to understand and derive insights on the company's best-selling month, month-on-month increase or decrease in sales, days of the week and time of the week with the highest sales, average daily sale, sales on weekdays and weekends, best-selling product and store with the highest sales. The results of this analysis would provide meaningful insights and recommendations that can be used to make decisions. I was also able to have a sharpening of my skillfulness in using SQL.

DATA SOURCE

The coffee sales data was gotten from Kaggle.

DATA STRUCTURE

The dataset is a six-months coffee sales data containing 11 columns and 149,116 rows. The dataset contains information on products, orders, sales details. The query below is used to get an overview of the data structure.

RECOMMENDATION

- Leveraging technology for online ordering and delivery services, the company can provide added convenience to their customers and expand their reach beyond physical locations, ultimately driving business growth and increasing profitability on weekends.

- Leveraging peak hours effectively, the company can capitalize on high-demand periods to drive sales, increase profitability, and enhance the overall customer experience.

- Identifying possible factors affecting sales in the least revenue generating month and putting a strategy in place to drive sales in those months by analyzing external factors such as seasonality, holidays, weather conditions, and local events that may impact customer traffic and purchasing behavior.

- The company should consider evaluating least selling product types to put a strategy or marketing in place to drive sales and also consider improving on the quality of those products.

- Getting feedback from customers about their experiences with the least selling product types. This would help identify any issues or concerns they may have, such as taste, quality, portion size, or value for money.

- The company should identify areas for improvement based on customer feedback from the least revenue generating stores, such as pricing, service quality, or overall customer experience.

CONCLUSION

By implementing the recommendations, the coffee-shop can increase profitability and optimize sales strategy.
