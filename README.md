INTRODUCTION

In every organization, sales performance analysis should never be compromised on. The aim of this analysis is to understand and derive insights on the company's best-selling month, month-on-month increase or decrease in sales, days of the week and time of the week with the highest sales, average daily sale, sales on weekdays and weekends, best-selling product and store with the highest sales. The results of this analysis would provide meaningful insights and recommendations that can be used to make decisions. I was also able to have a sharpening of my skillfulness in using SQL.
